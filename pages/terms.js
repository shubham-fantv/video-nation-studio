          Service is subject to these terms, the Community Guidelines and the Copyright Policy which
          may be updated from time to time. These terms, along with the Community Guidelines and the
          Copyright Policy are together hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement". Please read this
          Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the
          Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service. By accepting
          this Agreement, you affirm that you are 18 years of age or above and are fully competent
          to enter into this Agreement, and to abide by and comply with this Agreement. In case you
          are below 18 years of age, the restrictions and requirements below apply. Who may use the
          Service? a. Age Requirements You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service.
          However, children of all ages may use the Service if enabled by a parent or legal
          guardian. b. Permission by Parent or Guardian If you are considered a minor in your
          country, you represent that you have your parent or guardian’s permission to use the
          Service. Please have them read this Agreement with you. If you are a parent or legal
          guardian of a minor in your country, by allowing your child to use the Service, you are
          subject to the terms of this Agreement and responsible for your child’s activity on the
          Service. c. Businesses If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or
          organisation, you represent that you have authority to act on behalf of that entity, and

          The content on the Service includes videos, audios (for example music and other sounds),
          graphics, photos, text (such as comments and scripts), branding (including trade names,
          trademarks, service marks, or logos), interactive features, software, metrics, and other
          materials (hereinafter referred to as the "Content”). Content is the responsibility of the
          person or entity that provides it to the Service. VideoNation is under no obligation to
          host or serve Content. If you see any Content you believe does not comply with this
          Agreement, including by violating the Community Guidelines or the law, you can report it
          to us. b. VideoNation Accounts and VideoNation Channels You can use parts of the Service,
          such as browsing and searching for Content, without having a VideoNation account. However,
          you do need a VideoNation account to use some features. With a VideoNation account, you
          may be able to like videos, subscribe to channels, create your own VideoNation channel,
          earn rewards and more. Creating a VideoNation channel will give you access to additional
          features and functions, such as uploading videos, making comments. To protect your
          VideoNation account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your
          VideoNation account password on third-party applications. Your Information Our Privacy
          Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the
          Service. a. Permissions and Restrictions You may access and use the Service as made
          available to you, as long as you comply with this Agreement and applicable law. You may
          view or listen to Content for your personal, non-commercial use. The following
          restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to: a) access,
          reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter,
          modify or otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as expressly
          authorized by the Service; or (b) with prior written permission from VideoNation and, if
          applicable, the respective rights holders; b) circumvent, disable, fraudulently engage
          with, or otherwise interfere with any part of the Service (or attempt to do any of these
          things), including security-related features or features that (a) prevent or restrict the
          copying or other use of Content or (b) limit the use of the Service or Content; c) access
          the Service using any automated means; d) collect or harvest any information that might
          identify a person (for example, usernames or faces); e) use the Service to distribute
          unsolicited promotional or commercial content or other unwanted or mass solicitations; f)
          cause or encourage any inaccurate measurements of genuine user engagement with the
          Service, including by paying people or providing them with incentives to increase a
          video’s views, likes, or dislikes, or to increase a channel’s subscribers, or otherwise
          manipulate metrics in any manner; g) misuse any reporting, flagging, complaint, dispute,
          or appeals process, including by making groundless, vexatious, or frivolous submissions;
          h) run contests on or through the Service; i) use the Service to view or listen to Content
          other than for personal, non-commercial use (for example, you may not publicly screen
          videos or stream music from the Service). Reservation Using the Service does not give you
          ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including usernames or any other
          Content posted by others or VideoNation. Develop, Improve and Update the Service
          VideoNation is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual
          evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as
          adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services
          or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any
          part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply
          with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may
          affect all users, some users or even an individual user. When the Service requires or
          includes downloadable software, that software may update automatically on your device once
          a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make
          material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with
          reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse,
          responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. Your
          Content and Conduct a. Uploading Content If you have a VideoNation channel, you may be
          able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business
          or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the
          Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the VideoNation
          Community Guidelines) or the applicable law(s). In particular, the Content must: a)
          respect the rights of others, including privacy; b) not include third-party intellectual
          property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are
          otherwise legally entitled to do so; c) not abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten
          or encourage such abuse or harm), including against children; d) not mislead, be patently
          false, or defrauding; e) not illegally impersonate, defame, bully, harass, be obscene or
          stalk others; f) not incite violation of applicable laws; g) not abuse, harm, interfere
          with, or disrupt the services - for example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or
          deceptive ways, introducing malware, or spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or
          protective measures; h) not affect the sovereignty and integrity of any State; i) not be
          likely to incite violence or disturb the maintenance of public order. You are legally
          responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use internal systems,
          wherever possible, to analyse your Content and help detect infringement and abuse,
          including spam and malware. b. Rights you Grant You retain ownership rights in your
          Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to VideoNation and other users
          of the Service, as described below. i. License to VideoNation By providing Content to the
          Service, you grant to VideoNation a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
          sublicensable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare
          derivative works, display and perform it). VideoNation may only use that Content in
          connection with the Service and VideoNation’s (and its successors and Affiliates)
          business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the
          Service. ii. License to Other Users You also grant other users of the Service a worldwide,
          non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use
          that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and
          perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or
          embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to
          make use of your Content independent of the Service. iii. Duration of License The licenses
          granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or
          delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that VideoNation
          may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that
          have been removed or deleted. c. Right to Monetize You grant to VideoNation the right to
          monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on
          or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you
          to any payments. d. Removing Your Content You may remove your Content from the Service at
          any time. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these
          terms. e. Removal of Content by VideoNation If we reasonably believe that any of your
          Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to VideoNation, our
          users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down that Content in
          accordance with applicable law. We will attempt to reasonably notify you with the reason
          for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the
          direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for
          VideoNation or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or
          operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party,
          VideoNation or our Affiliates. f. Community Guidelines Strikes VideoNation operates a
          system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates these terms along with the
          VideoNation Community Guidelines. Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may
          result in the permanent removal of your channel from VideoNation. If you believe that a
          strike has been issued in error, you may appeal here. If your channel has been restricted
          due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions.
          Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and we reserve the
          right to terminate your VideoNation account or your access to all or part of the Service.
          Copyright Protection If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service,
          please send us an intimation. We shall attempt to respond to your intimation of alleged
          copyright infringement according to the laws applicable. VideoNation's policies provide
          for the termination, in appropriate circumstances. Account Suspension & Termination a.
          Terminations by You You may stop using the Service at any time. b. Terminations and
          Suspensions by VideoNation VideoNation reserves the right to suspend or terminate your
          VideoNation account or your access to all or part of the Service if: (a) you materially or
          repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal
          requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or
          could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, VideoNation or our
          Affiliates. c. Notice for Termination or Suspension We will notify you with the reason for
          termination or suspension by VideoNation unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a)
          would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority; (b) would
          compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of
          the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, VideoNation or our
          Affiliates. Where VideoNation is terminating your use for Service changes, where
          reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from
          the Service. d. Effect of Account Suspension or Termination If your VideoNation account is
          terminated or your access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain
          aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will
          continue to apply to such use. If you believe that the termination or suspension of your
          VideoNation account has been made in error, you can appeal here. About Software in the
          Service a. Downloadable Software When the Service requires or includes downloadable
          software, unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license,
          VideoNation gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and
          non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by VideoNation as part of the
          Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit
          of the Service as provided by VideoNation, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You
          are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, sublicense or lease any part of the
          software, unless you have VideoNation’s written permission. b. Open Source Some software
          used in our Service may be offered under an open source, royalty-free license that we
          provide to you. There may be provisions in an open-source license that expressly override
          some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses. Rewards. VideoNation offers
          its users reward in form of coins for their regular and continuous use of the Service.
          These reward points are provided for performing various actions on the website such as
          watching videos, liking videos, commenting on videos, sharing videos. Each user who
          watches the content earns reward points (hereinafter referred to as “Coins”). These reward
          points are rewarded purely for the regular use of the website and the website does not
          permit any purchase or accrual of these reward points in any other way. These reward
          points may be redeemed by Users to participate in various rewards/offers that are run by
          the website for all users from time to time. VideoNation reserves the right, at its sole
          discretion, to change the mode of the accrual of one or any of these types of reward
          points, including the number of such reward points received in proportion to the User’s
          activities. Further, VideoNation reserves the right to disqualify any User, who does not
          meet the offer requirements or for any other reason including but not limited to any
          misuse of the offer or fraud or suspicious transaction/activity or under any legal
          requirement or applicable rules and regulations, from receiving any reward points.
          VideoNation also reserves the right to discontinue or change or issue any new form of
          reward points offered at any time, at its sole discretion. VideoNation may also at its
          discretion specify an expiry period for the Coins. VideoNation is not responsible for any
          tax implications on any Eligible Participant from their participation in any of the
          offers. a. Use of Store: The number of Coins needed to avail any of the offers available
          shall be decided by Fan TV. VideoNation, in its sole discretion, may choose to alter the
          number of Coins needed to claim an offer at any point of time. b. Disclaimers: i. The
          Reward Promotions are offered to the Users on an “as is” basis and without warranty or
          condition. The Reward Promotions may not be uninterrupted or error-free. Users waive all
          claims against VideoNation. ii. Where the rewards are in the nature of coupons or
          vouchers, the Users must contact the commercial partner offering the coupon or voucher for
          any customer support or queries. iii. VideoNation reserves the right to deactivate or
          delete the User account, all related information on it, and forfeit all Coins related
          prizes from any User, in the event of misuse of the offer, fraud or suspicious
          transaction/activity on the VideoNation website. iv. VideoNation is not responsible for
          any tax implications on the User from their participation in any Reward Promotion. Users
          should obtain an independent tax advice before entering any Reward Promotion. Other Legal
          Terms a. Warranty Disclaimer Other than as expressly stated in this Agreement or as
          required by law, the service is provided “as is” and VideoNation does not make any
          specific commitments or warranties about the service. b. Limitation of Liability Except as
          required by applicable law, VideoNation, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees
          and agents will not be responsible for any loss of profits, revenues, business
          opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings; loss or corruption of data; indirect or
          consequential loss; punitive damages caused by: A. Errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies on
          the service; B. Personal injury or property damage resulting from your use of the service;
          C. Any unauthorized use of the service; D. Any interruption or cessation of the service;
          E. Any viruses or malicious code transmitted to or through the service by any third party;
          F. Any content whether submitted by a user or VideoNation, including your use of content;
          and/or G. The removal or unavailability of any content. H. This provision applies to any
          claim, regardless of whether the claim asserted is based on warranty, contract, tort, or
          any other legal theory. c. Indemnity To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree
          to defend, indemnify and hold harmless VideoNation, its Affiliates, officers, directors,
          employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
          liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees)
          arising from: (i) your use of the Service; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms
          of Service; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation
          any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your Content caused
          damage to a third party. This defence and indemnification obligation will survive this
          Agreement and your use of the Service. Third-Party Links The Service may contain links to
          third-party websites and online services that are not owned or controlled by VideoNation.
          VideoNation has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and
          online services. Be aware when you leave the Service; we suggest you read the terms and
          privacy policy of each third-party website and online service that you visit. About this
          Agreement a. Changing this Agreement We may change this Agreement, (1) to reflect changes
          to our Service or how we do business - for example, when we add new products or features
          or remove old ones, (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent
          abuse or harm. If we materially change this Agreement, we’ll provide you with reasonable
          advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new
          product or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or
          responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove
          any Content you uploaded and stop using the Service. b. Continuation of this Agreement If
          your use of the Service ends, the following terms of this Agreement will continue to apply
          to you: “Other Legal Terms”, “About This Agreement”, and the licenses granted by you will
          continue as described under “Duration of License”. c. Severance If it turns out that a
          particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect
          any other terms. d. No Waiver If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take
          immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have
          (such as the right to take action in the future). e. Interpretation In these terms,
          “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give
          are for illustrative purposes. f. Governing Law Laws of United Arab Emirates will govern
          all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service, regardless of
          conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the courts of
          Dubai, and you and VideoNation consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.`}
